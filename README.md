<font size="7">Topic Overview:
The National Football League is no stranger to having its players run into legal issues in its history as a sport. In the last 15 or so years there have been rule changes and initiaves brougt out by the NFL in attempts to bring down the amount of crime associated with its athletes. We used data, from 2000-2017, looking at all the details possible surrounding the arrests in order to unearth patterns, connections and to see if the NFL's goal is trending in the positive direction and working towards becoming accomplished. 

<font size="7">Research Questions and Motivations:
As a group we were curious about whether playing a certain position, how often you're get or getting hit, had an connection to commiting more or less crimes. On top of that we wondered if the NFL's inititives had any affect on the behavior of the players off the field.
  - Are Defensive Players Committing More Violent Crimes?
  - Has the NFL Successfully Decreased Crime in Their Organization?

Create extra catagories (DV & others) to grab extra datapoints necessary to our hypothesis testing. Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickmurphy/nfl-arrests/data

<font size="7">Data Analysis Process:
To better understand these statistics we needed to analyze our data and create certain graphs to decide on our hypothesis:
  - <font size="6">Hypothesis Testing
  
  We hypothesized that defensive players would commit more crimes than offensive players because how often they are slamming their heads into the opposition. We also thought that the NFL would not be able to decrease crime amongst its players.

<font size="7">Project Analysis:

Question 1: WHen looking at our first the equestion of "Whether Defensive Players commit more violent crimes", we theorized that yes they would because we assumed that these positions create more contact than offensive players and therefor it's in their nature to be more vilent off the field. These types of hits can create trauma on the brain, commingly known as CTE, and we assumed this repeated trauma would cause more violence off the field than offensive players. Based on the data we have, we cannot come to the conclusion that defensive players are commiting more violent crimes. The connection we can make is that the players that receive the most contact are more likely to commit violent crimes and crimes in general. Of the top 4 positions commitng violent crimes, half are offensive and the other half are defensive.

Question 2: Our second question is attempting to find out whether the National Football League has been successful in decreasing the amount of crime its players are committing. Our hypothesis was that no, the NFL has not been successful because with the influx of social media and with the amount of videos coming out showcasing various assaults and the immense backlash the NFL was given there was no reason to believe they had made any success. After running our analysis we found that after the 2006 change in NFL policy, that delt with all crime, there were less violent crimes being committed year after year due to the enhanced repercussions from the policy. After the NFL policy change in 2014, that delt with violent crimes but specifically domestic violence, we found that these crimes did decrease but due to the lack of overall data we felt it was inconclusive.

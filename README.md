<font size="7">Topic Overview:
The National Football League is no stranger to having its players run into legal issues in its history as a sport. In the last 15 or so years there have been rule changes and initiaves brougt out by the NFL in attempts to bring down the amount of crime associated with its athletes. We used data, from 2000-2017, looking at all the details possible surrounding the arrests in order to unearth patterns, connections and to see if the NFL's goal is trending in the positive direction and working towards becoming accomplished.

  - Are Defensive Players Committing More Violent Crimes?
  - Has the NFL Successfully Decreased Crime in Their Organization?
